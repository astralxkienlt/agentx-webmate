# {{productName}} — browser delegation

{{productName}} is the browser extension living in the side panel of the user's
own Chrome, already signed in to every site the user uses. This skill hands it
whole browser tasks over MCP — opening a video, reading an SSO dashboard,
pulling rows out of webmail, filling a form on an internal tool — and brings
the result back into the conversation. The agent never drives the page click
by click; the extension's own agent, site adapters and per-host permission gate
do that.

The skill is host-neutral: it ships the MCP server itself
(`scripts/{{bundleFile}}`, one file, Node.js ≥ 20 only) and works in any agent
that loads agentskills.io skills and speaks MCP — AgentX Workmate (Hermes),
Claude Code, and others. Hosts show the tools under their own prefix, e.g.
`{{hostTool:run}}` in both Workmate and Claude Code.

## When to Use

- The page needs the **user's login**: SaaS dashboards behind SSO, webmail,
  admin panels, banking, internal tools — cookies and MFA already passed in
  their browser.
- The user points at **their** browser: "the tab I have open", "my account",
  "open YouTube / Gmail / …".
- You need **structured data** from an authenticated page (`{{tool:extract}}`
  with a JSON Schema).

Do **not** use it when the page is public and only needs reading (use your
host's fetch/search tools or headless browser), when the task is a plain HTTP
API call, or when the user is on Firefox (no bridge there).

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js ≥ 20** on `PATH`.
2. **Put this folder where your agent loads skills** (folder name must stay
   `{{skillName}}`):
   - AgentX Workmate / Hermes: `$AGENTX_HOME/skills/autonomous-ai-agents/{{skillName}}/`
   - Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/{{skillName}}/` (or `.claude/skills/` inside a project)
   - any other agentskills.io-compatible agent: its skills directory
3. **Register the bundled server once** (idempotent; re-run after moving the folder):
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/setup.py
   ```
   It registers with every MCP host it finds — AgentX Workmate (`mcp_servers.{{skillName}}`
   in the profile's `config.yaml`) and Claude Code (`claude mcp add --transport stdio
   --scope user {{skillName}} -- node …/{{bundleFile}}`) — and prints a generic
   `mcpServers` JSON block for any other host (Codex, Cursor, …). Options:
   `--host workmate|claude|mcp-json`, `--project DIR` (write `DIR/.mcp.json`),
   `--home PATH` (another Workmate profile), `--dry-run`.
   Then reload: Workmate `/reload-mcp` or a new session; Claude Code restart or `/mcp`.
4. **Extension attached.** Nothing to switch on: in a Chromium browser with
   {{productName}} installed the bridge ships enabled at
   `ws://127.0.0.1:17374/extension`. **Settings → General → Advanced → Cloud
   bridge** shows the status line, which reads **Connected** while a session of
   the host is running (it hosts the server). Check there if a profile was
   pointed at another port or the bridge was turned off.
5. **Same machine.** The bridge is loopback-only on both ends; from a remote
   box forward the port: `ssh -L 17374:127.0.0.1:17374 REMOTE_HOST`.
6. **The extension has its own model** (its own sign-in / provider). The
   agent's model choice does not apply to the browser side.
7. Only **one bridge socket at a time**: 17373 (Cloud), 17374 (this server),
   17375 (LM Studio plugin).

## How to Run

```
{{tool:connection}}()
{{tool:run}}(task="open youtube.com, search for 'Anh Nhớ Ra Rằng Vũ' and play the official video", mode="act")
{{tool:run}}(task="summarise the thread that is open in Gmail", mode="ask")
{{tool:extract}}(task="list overdue invoices on this page", output_schema={"type":"object","properties":{"invoices":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer":{"type":"string"},"amount":{"type":"number"},"due_date":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer","amount","due_date"]}}},"required":["invoices"]})
{{tool:status}}(run_id="mcp_…")
{{tool:respond}}(run_id="mcp_…", clarify_id="perm_…", answer="once")
{{tool:abort}}(run_id="mcp_…")
```

Your host prefixes these with the server key: `{{hostTool:run}}`, and so on.

Health check without a chat session: `python3 scripts/check_bridge.py`.

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Use it for | Key arguments | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{{tool:connection}}` | Is the extension attached? Call first after any failure. | — | `Connected…` or fix-it instructions |
| `{{tool:run}}` | Any browser task | `task`, `mode` (`ask` read-only / `act` navigate+interact), `timeout_seconds`, `wait`, `tab_id`, `allow_api_mutations` | `run_id`, `status`, `final_url`, result text |
| `{{tool:extract}}` | Predictable JSON from an authenticated page (always Ask mode) | `task`, `output_schema`, `timeout_seconds` | JSON matching the schema |
| `{{tool:status}}` | Poll a run that outlived its timeout; list runs | `run_id` (omit to list) | snapshot |
| `{{tool:respond}}` | Answer a `needs_user_input` pause | `run_id`, `clarify_id`, `answer` — permission requests: exactly `once` / `always` / `deny` | snapshot after resuming |
| `{{tool:abort}}` | Stop a run (completed actions are not undone) | `run_id` | final snapshot |

Statuses: `running`, `needs_user_input`, `completed`, `failed`, `aborted`.

## Procedure

1. **Check the connection once per session.** Call `{{tool:connection}}`. If it
   says *Not connected*, relay its instructions to the user verbatim (open
   Chrome, enable the Cloud bridge on port 17374) and stop. Do not retry the
   task in a loop.
2. **Pick the mode from the verb in the task.** `mode="ask"` reads, extracts
   and summarises the page that is already open; it cannot navigate, click,
   type or submit. Use `mode="act"` the moment the task opens a site, searches
   on it, plays something, clicks, types or submits — "open YouTube" is an
   Act task. Starting such a task in Ask mode only wastes a round trip.
3. **Write the task like a brief to a colleague.** Name the site, the account if
   several exist, the time range, the fields you want back, and the success
   criterion. The extension cannot see this conversation; everything it needs
   must be in `task`.
4. **Prefer `{{tool:extract}}` for data.** Give an object-root JSON Schema with
   `required` fields so the result is predictable. Use `{{tool:run}}` when the
   task needs interaction or a prose answer.
5. **Handle the result by status.**
   - `completed` — read `--- result ---`; report `final_url` when useful.
   - `needs_user_input`, **permission request** — the text starts with
     `PERMISSION REQUEST — {{productName}} wants to navigate to youtube.com` and
     lists `accepted answers: once | always | deny`. Ask the user — with your
     host's question tool (`clarify` in AgentX Workmate, AskUserQuestion in
     Claude Code) or in plain chat — then call `{{tool:respond}}` with
     **exactly one token**: "có / ừ / ok / đồng ý / yes / cho phép" → `once`;
     "luôn luôn / always allow / remember" → `always`; "không / no / từ chối"
     → `deny`. Never forward the user's words verbatim — the browser treats
     anything else as deny, and the server rejects it.
   - `needs_user_input`, **question** (e.g. "Which account should I use?") —
     put the question to the user and pass their answer through verbatim. If
     the text lists `accepted answers`, send one of those exactly.
   - `running (still running — poll {{tool:status}})` — the timeout elapsed but
     the browser is still working. Poll `{{tool:status}}` with the `run_id`;
     raise `timeout_seconds` (up to 3600) on long tasks instead of re-running.
   - `failed` — read `error`. "denied" means the permission was refused (by the
     user, or by a wrong token); ask before retrying. A missing-page error
     usually means the wrong tab or account; refine `task` rather than
     switching modes blindly.
6. **Stop cleanly.** If the user changes their mind, call `{{tool:abort}}` with
   the `run_id`. Say plainly that actions already taken stay taken.
7. **Report.** Summarise what the extension did and where it ended
   (`final_url`). Quote extracted data; do not paraphrase numbers.

## Pitfalls

- **Two browsers.** If your host has its own headless browser tools, they
  drive a separate Chromium; the extension drives the user's real Chrome. Do
  not mix them in one task — state in one is invisible to the other.
- **Permission answers are tokens, not prose.** `once` / `always` / `deny`
  only. `always` persists a grant for that host in the user's browser — use it
  only when the user explicitly asks to stop being prompted for that site. If
  the extension's side panel is open on the tab, the user may also click the
  request there; either path resolves the run.
- **One run per tab.** "Tab N already has an active run" means a run is still
  going — `{{tool:status}}` it, `{{tool:respond}}` to it, or `{{tool:abort}}` it.
- **Timeouts do not abort.** A run reported as *still running* was not cancelled.
- **Do not put secrets in `task`.** The session is already authenticated; if a
  credential is truly needed the run pauses and the user types it in the browser.
- **`allow_api_mutations` is almost never right.** It lets the extension issue
  mutating HTTP calls instead of clicking through the visible UI. Leave it off
  unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- **Firefox cannot host the bridge**; say so instead of suggesting settings.
- **The server lives only while a host session runs.** Between sessions the
  extension shows *Reconnecting…*; that is normal.
- **Moved the skill folder?** Re-run `scripts/setup.py` — registrations hold
  the absolute path of the bundled server.

## Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/check_bridge.py
```

Expected: `server_build OK`, `node OK`, at least one host `registered`, and
`bridge port … listening` while a session is open (or *not listening* between
sessions, which the script explains). Then, in a session:

1. `{{tool:connection}}()` → `Connected. Listening on ws://127.0.0.1:17374/extension.`
2. `{{tool:run}}(task="read the title and first paragraph of the active tab",
   mode="ask")` → `status: completed` with the page text.
3. `{{tool:run}}(task="open youtube.com and read the first video title",
   mode="act")` → `PERMISSION REQUEST … navigate to youtube.com` →
   `{{tool:respond}}(…, answer="once")` → `status: completed`.
