/**
 * Branded MCP server for the browser extension (AgentX WebMate, netMind, …).
 *
 * Gives AgentX Workmate — or any other MCP client (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor)
 * — the ability to delegate a browser task to the user's REAL browser session:
 * already logged in, cookies present, MFA already passed. That session is the
 * thing a headless automation framework cannot reproduce, and it is the only
 * reason this server is interesting.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately coarse. We expose task delegation, not the ~50
 * low-level browser primitives, because:
 *   1. the permission gate lives in the extension's agent loop, not in
 *      `executeTool()`, so per-primitive access would bypass every safety
 *      property the extension advertises; and
 *   2. driving 50 primitives over a socket costs a round trip and a pile of
 *      tokens per click. Delegation is both safer and cheaper.
 *
 * Every user-visible name comes from brand/brand.config.json via
 * src/brand.generated.ts (see scripts/brand.mjs), so a brand branch differs in
 * config only. stdout belongs to the MCP stdio transport; logging goes to stderr.
