/**
 * Structured error codes the six tools attach to their failures.
 *
 * AgentX Workmate watches tool results for these strings and turns them into
 * a card ("Workmate wants to use your browser — install WebMate?") instead of
 * letting the agent paraphrase a stack of plumbing text. Each code therefore
 * appears twice in a failing result: as the prefix of the human-readable
 * text and as `structuredContent.code`. Keep the list in sync with
 * `apps/desktop/electron/webmate/` in the Workmate repository.
 *
 *   WEBMATE_DISABLED       reserved for the host — when Workmate has the MCP
 *                          server switched off this process never runs, so
 *                          the host raises this one itself.
 *   WEBMATE_NOT_INSTALLED  Workmate pairing is configured but no extension
 *                          folder exists, so nothing can ever dial in.
 *   WEBMATE_NOT_CONNECTED  installed (or dev mode) but no browser attached.
 *   WEBMATE_OUTDATED       the attached extension speaks a protocol too old
 *                          for this server.
 *   WEBMATE_NOT_SIGNED_IN  attached, but nobody is signed in to the extension
 *                          so it has no model to run with.
 *   WEBMATE_PORT_IN_USE    another process holds the bridge port.
